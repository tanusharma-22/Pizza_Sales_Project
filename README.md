This project analyzes pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance and customer preferences using SQL and Excel. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) and sales trends to make data-driven decisions that help optimize marketing strategies, inventory management, and operational efficiency. By leveraging SQL, we efficiently extract and manipulate data to calculate critical metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of sales performance and customer buying behavior. Excel is used to create dynamic visualizations, enabling stakeholders to identify trends, seasonality, and peak sales periods. The visualizations also help compare sales performance across different pizza categories and sizes, revealing customer preferences and popular menu items.
